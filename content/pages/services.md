    It’s all in the detail.  We agonize over it here at Plastic Wax and hope
    that shows in the work we do.


    We’re big believers in reality based source material, whether that be for our texture and asset libraries, realistic motion on our performance capture stage or the use of photogrammetry for the creation of assets.  Not only is our focus on the creative aspects of our projects, were continually developing tools and investing in R&D to perfect the technology as we push the boundaries of what can be done.


    Photorealistic CG characters starts in our digital photo scan studio.  This suite consists of a hemispherical array of 12 x DSLR’s, on a synchronized remote trigger system, allowing us to capture ultra sharp images of our subject in perfect unison. This provides us with crucial high resolution data of the subject’s subtle facial features (down to the pore level) from every angle.

    Having free access to a MOCAP stage allows us to accelerate the early stages
    of previz into animation, giving more time on look development, refinement
    and importantly iterative collaboration with your team.  


    Plastic Wax houses its own on site 24 camera VICON mocap stage, which is able to capture and stream live motion capture data real-time.  This rapid and cost effective form of ‘in-engine previz’ allows us to assemble a working edit immediately after the mocap shoot allowing for rapid turnaround of animatics during the early stages of the project.   


    We work with world class acting and stunt talent, choreographing and directing their performance.  We’re able to simultaneously capture their body and facial performance, which is retargeted to the actual 3D models for us to see on set in real-time.  And with our highly detailed facial rigging systems, we can ensure those very subtle and nuanced performances is captured and applied to our 3D characters.

    Here at Plastic Wax we live and breathe this space.


    We love the magic of 'realtime animation', and the creative power it affords our game centric studio team who speak a cinematic language. With added efficiency and creative spontaneity, it's the marriage of filmic vision with the technical in-engine know-how that has been the cornerstone of our success.


    And we've been doing this now for 22 years, distilling down our in-house mocap tech, and working intimately across both game and cinematic productions.


    Our vision is to create a true film pipeline in Unreal, with realtime cinematography, and offering an array of customisable toolsets including remote-camera viewing and recording. We believe that 'realtime animation' will revolutionise the animation industry, and we're proud to be one of the pioneers with a solid track record to meet this exciting new future.
